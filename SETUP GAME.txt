.You have to play the game in fullscreen in Visual Studio Code and you must install Java plugin on VS code before.\.If the animation of the game isn't working , Try going to the script and edit line 160 which says : "this.ConsoleUp(18);"You can try changing the number 18 to more or less depending on your screen size.What this line of code does is create extra lines to act as margin between the bottom of the console and the game display area.The more you increase the number the bigger the margin (if you increase the number too much the game display area will start to disappear so it's recommended to keep it around 10-20 depending on your display)The reason why it is necessary to change this value from time to time is because it's hard to make an animated screen in Java Console so we can attempt to find a solution to do this by constantly printing the information on each frame. Although the printing layout will differ depending on the screen display and resolution which will cause this problem.Watch the Video on Youtube for better understanding of how to set it up correctly before trying it.
